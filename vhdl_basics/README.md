# VHDL Basics

This folder contains basic VHDL examples and exercises for learning fundamental concepts in digital design using VHDL.

---

## Overview

- Boolean types and logic
- Literal assignments
- Vector operations and comparisons

Each `.vhd` file demonstrates a specific concept with simple, easy-to-read code.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Define and use boolean data types
- Perform literal assignments in VHDL
- Create and manipulate bit vectors
- Compare vectors using logical operations

## File Descriptions

| File                | Description                                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------  |
| `bool_type.vhd`     | Demonstrates the use of `boolean`, `bit`, and logic operators. |
| `literal_assign.vhd`| Shows how to assign values to signals using literals.          |
| `vector_comp.vhd`   | Compares and manipulates bit vectors.                          |
| `if_example.vhd`    | Uses `process` to enable sequential logic.                       |
