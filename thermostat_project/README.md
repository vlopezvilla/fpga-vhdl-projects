# Lab 1: Thermostat Project 

### Directions for the Project:

1) current_temp, a 7 bit vector, as an input
2) desired_temp, a 7 bit vector, as an input
3) display_select, a signle bit
4) The design will have one output, temp_display.

5) The logic we want is that if the display_select is a '1' we want to put current_temp out on temp_display, but if the display_select is a '0', we want to put desired_temp on the output temp_display.
6) 
#### You should create an entity and architecture for this lab.   You should then simulate in either Modelsim or Vivado.
